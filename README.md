# Pacman Game Search Problems & Spam Classifier

This repository contains a core project completed as part of an Artificial Intelligence work:

1. Pacman Multi-Agent Search – an interactive Pacman environment to experiment with AI agents.

# 🕹️🎮 Pacman Multi-Agent Search

This project extends the UC Berkeley Pacman AI framework. The goal is to design agents that make decisions in the Pacman game world.

## Features:

ReflexAgent – evaluates moves greedily based on immediate surroundings.

MinimaxAgent – implements adversarial search with a minimax algorithm.

AlphaBetaAgent – optimizes minimax with alpha–beta pruning.

ExpectimaxAgent – models uncertainty by assuming ghosts act stochastically.

KeyboardAgent – allows manual play.

## Layouts:

Includes a variety of boards (smallClassic, mediumClassic, originalClassic, openClassic, contestClassic, etc.) to test different strategies.
