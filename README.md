# Pacman Game Search Problems

This repository contains a core project completed as part of an Artificial Intelligence work:

1. Pacman Multi-Agent Search – an interactive Pacman environment to experiment with AI agents.

# 🕹️🎮 Pacman Multi-Agent Search

This project extends the UC Berkeley Pacman AI framework. The goal is to design agents that make decisions in the Pacman game world.

## Features:

- ReflexAgent – evaluates moves greedily based on immediate surroundings.

- MinimaxAgent – implements adversarial search with a minimax algorithm.

- AlphaBetaAgent – optimizes minimax with alpha–beta pruning.

- ExpectimaxAgent – models uncertainty by assuming ghosts act stochastically.

- KeyboardAgent – allows manual play.

## Layouts:

Includes a variety of boards (smallClassic, mediumClassic, originalClassic, openClassic, contestClassic, etc.) to test different strategies.

# 🔹 Real-World Relevance

Although this project is built around the classic Pacman game, it serves as a powerful platform to experiment with Artificial Intelligence algorithms that have direct applications in the real world. The multi-agent search techniques (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax, Reinforcement Learning, etc.) demonstrated here are widely used in:

- Autonomous Navigation – guiding self-driving cars, delivery drones, and robots through dynamic environments while avoiding obstacles.

- Strategic Decision-Making – optimizing moves in adversarial scenarios such as cybersecurity defense, financial trading, and competitive resource management.

- Reinforcement Learning – training intelligent agents to learn from trial and error, which is foundational for robotics, modern gaming AI, and automation systems.

- Education & Research – providing a visual, interactive way to understand and analyze complex AI concepts, making it easier to debug, compare, and extend algorithms.

✅ In essence, Pacman becomes more than a game—it is a controlled, interactive simulation environment for developing and testing intelligent agents that mirror real-world challenges in robotics, automation, and AI-driven decision systems.
